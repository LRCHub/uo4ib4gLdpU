You shot the beauty right in its broken eye
You tattooed an anchor even though you're bound to fly

You invited the devil and the Jesus Christ
Baby, you have traveled for miles without love in your eyes

You've cut some corners, and you've bruised some eyes
With the perfect needle, you've got someone to crucify
As you poison your veins, nobody's gonna hear you cry
Baby, you have traveled for miles without love in your eyes

Baby, you have traveled for miles without love in your eyes
