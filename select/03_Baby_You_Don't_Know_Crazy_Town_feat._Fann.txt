Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Back in the day, in a downtown love
Lost in awhile ways
Talking 'bout money and escalates
But do caught up in the Escapades, uh

Careful what you wish for
'Cause you might get it, boy

All the pretty girls and expensive toys
All I ever wanted was to bring the noise
Well, like the rap pack with backpacks
Tube socks and fat sacks
Them cool casts that make snaps
With the boom back and then fat tracks
And this music's all I know
I can feel it in my bones
I get lost and then it walks me home
Whine me up and watch me go

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Take me away
I want more of these glory days
If I pause, replay
With the story changed
I won't walk away
Still got teen spirit like Kurt Cobain
And this elevated music brings on something glamourous
We ain't no amateurs
Just check the classics backing us
So back on up
In God we trust
Crazy Town, Los Angeles
Rock the beat like the metro bus
So come on pick it up
Just like you tryna play it off
'Cause you can't really win until you've ever truly lost

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

These streets are paved with gold
My eyes wide, my [?]
Time flies, friends go
These memories are like [?]
I've had some, I [?] more
These things that we stand for
This music's my mentor
This here's what I'm in for
My [?] my thoughts are pure
They gave me something now I want more
Rock it till my pocket's full
And I won't stop until I'm over every obstacle
Nothing here's impossible
For the live life, real talk
To morning light, my [?] rock
A misfit, [?]
When the feeling's right, I lift off
Hop in the air, hand on the wheel
I'mma just be patient
I know when I'm on my path I'mma reach my destination

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know

Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know
