You and i have been together for a long time
And at the very first baby you were so fine
Oh, and i remember the way you made me feel when you kissed me
Oh, honey you made me real

Yes, those were the very, very special days
When you made me want you in so many ways
Oh you were a lover, i couldn't think of any other
And i have to tell you now what i sometimes forget to say

Oh, baby you still got it you got everything i need
Baby you still got it and you give it all to me
And you know sometimes i think how sweet our lovin' used to be
Baby you still got it, baby you still got it,
Baby you still give it all to me

Yes, i still see you through the same eyes
And baby, it didn't take me long to realize
You were something special, and i would always be in your keeping
Oh honey, you made me feel what a woman wants to feel

And, baby you still got it you got everything i need
Baby you still got it and you give it all to me
And you know sometimes i think how sweet our lovin' used to be
Baby you still got it, baby you still got it,
Baby you still give it all to me

Oh, baby you still got it you got everything i need
Baby you still got it and you give it all to me
And you know sometimes i think how sweet our lovin' used to be
Baby you still got it, (you got it),
Baby you still got it, (you got it)
Baby you still give it all to me

Baby you still got it, baby you still got it
Baby you still got it, baby you still got it

Baby you still got it, baby you still got it
Baby you still got it, baby you still got it
