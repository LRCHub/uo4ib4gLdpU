Well, just, a look at that girl with the lights comin' up in her eyes
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
All the guys on the corner stand back and let her walk on by
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
'Cause she's so fine
She's probably somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah
She's probably somebody's baby, all right
I heard her talkin' with her friend
When she thought nobody else was around
She said she's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
'Cause when the cars and the signs and the street lights
Light up the town
She's got to be somebody's baby
She must be somebody's baby
She's got to be somebody's baby
She's so
She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah
She's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
I try to shut my eyes, but I can't get her outta my sight
I know I'm gonna know her, but I gotta get over my fright
Well, I'm just gonna walk up to her
I'm gonna talk to her tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
She's gonna be somebody's only light
Gonna shine tonight
Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight, yeah
Gonna shine tonight, make her mine tonight
