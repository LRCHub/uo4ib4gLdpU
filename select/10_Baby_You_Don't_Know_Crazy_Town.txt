Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name
Till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
Back in the day, in a downtown love
Lost in awhile ways
Talking 'bout money and escalates
But too caught up in the Escapades, uh
Careful what you wish for
'Cause you might get it, boy
All the pretty girls and expensive toys
All I ever wanted was to bring the noise
Well, like the rap pack with backpacks
Tube socks and fat sacks
Them cool casts that make snaps
With the boom back and then fat tracks
And this music's all I know
I can feel it in my bones
I get lost, then it walks me home
Whine me up and watch me go
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name
Till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
Take me away i want more of these glory days
If I pause, replay with the story changed
I won't walk away
Still got teen spirit like Kurt Cobain
And this elevated music brings
On something glamourous we ain't no amateurs
Just check the classics backing us
So back on up in God we trust
Crazy Town, Los Angeles
Rock the beat like the metro bus
So come on pick it up
Just like you tryna play it off
'Cause you can't really win until
You've ever truly lost
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name
Till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name
Till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
Baby, you don't know
These streets are paved with gold
My eyes wide, my end zone
Time flies, friends go
These memories are like echoes
I've had some, I plan more
These things that we stand for
Crowds wanna raise their hands for
Reasons that I grab my pen for
This music's my mentor
This here's what I'm meant for
My pen's out, my thoughts are pure
They gave me something now I want more
Rock it till my pocket's full
And I won't stop until
I'm over every obstacle
Nothing here's impossible
For the love life, real talk
To morning light, my lips rock
A misfit, thoughts crisscrossed
When the feeling's right, I lift off
Hop in the air, hand on the wheel
I'mma just be patient i know when I'm on my
Path I'mma reach my destination
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone
I like how you scream my name
Till it's early in the morning
Baby, you don't know what you
Got till it's gone, now
Baby, you don't know baby, you don't know
